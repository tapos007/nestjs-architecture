## API Response Standards

Our API uses a consistent response structure for all endpoints to ensure uniformity and ease of use. Below are the specifications for our standard and paginated responses.

### Standard API Response Format

All API responses follow this standard format to indicate success or failure, provide a message, and deliver the expected data:

```json
{
  "isSuccess": true,
  "message": "Request processed successfully",
  "data": {
    // Your data here
  }
}
```

### Paginated Response Format

For endpoints that return a list of items, we implement pagination and structure the response as follows to manage large sets of data effectively:

```json
{
  "isSuccess": true,
  "message": "Data fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      // Array of items
    ],
    "total": 120,
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

#### The paginated response includes:

- items: The current page of items from the dataset.
- total: Total number of items available.
- page: The current page number.
- limit: The number of items per page.

### Error Handling

Our API uses a global exception filter to catch and handle exceptions uniformly. This ensures that any error in the API delivers a structured response that maintains the format consistency:

```json
{
  "isSuccess": false,
  "message": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "data": null
}
```

### Validation Error Response

When a request fails due to validation errors, the API will respond with a 426 Bad Request status and provide detailed error messages:

```json
{
  "isSuccess": false,
  "message": "Validation errors occurred",
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "username",
      "error": ["Username is required", "Username must be 8 character long"]
    },
    {
      "field": "email",
      "error": ["Email is required", "Email must be valid email address"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Status Codes

Our API uses conventional HTTP response status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- 200 OK: The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method used.

- 400 Bad Request: Error Response

- 401 Unauthorized: The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
- 403 Forbidden: The client does not have access rights to the content.
- 404 Not Found: Api Not found .
- 426 Validation error .
- 429 To much Request .
- 500 Internal Server Error: The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.
